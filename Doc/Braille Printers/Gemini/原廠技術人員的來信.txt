Subject: Fw: regarding GEMINI

Dear Marcus,

Here is the answer form our engineer Mr.Maruno as followings;

Here we have attached files for Gemini (PDFfile) It is easy to output normal characters date, But  I think it is complicated to output  graphic image date, For your reference,we have attached sample program to output  graphic image date (sample2.zip) FontImage.zip is a classlibrary to make graphic from font.
(Its the latest version in sample2.zip, however some comments are written by Japanese, so we wonder if you could use it)

If  you have any questions, please contact us again.

Regards,
